It is usually underneath the button to check for updates. If you do not know how to run the optional updates, check out this link:\nhttps://pureinfotech.com/install-optional-updates-windows-10/ \n\n\u2691 Allow those to finish, restart your computer, then attempt to use the hardware / software that you were initially trying to.\n\n\u2691 If you have a Kensington docking station at your desk, you may also want to power cycle that device as well, as that addresses many of the common display and audio issues staff members run into. To do this, locate the black cylindrical cable that is in the lowest possible port in the back panel. Unplug that cord, allow about 30 seconds to pass, plug the cord back in and see if that resolved your issue.\n\nIf you have concerns about these steps, or they did not work, please feel free to give us a call at {phone}, {days}, {hours}.

You can do this by clicking the little speaker symbol on the lower right-hand side of your taskbar, then selecting the correct output. You will also want to check the audio cable that links your Juno to the Actiontec in your classroom, if you have one.\n\n\u2691 IF you turn the tower on and only get a white screen, THEN: power off the tower, wait a full and complete minute, then turn the tower back on\n\n\u2691 IF the display will not turn on at all, THEN: verify that the power supply is plugged into both the receiver, and a working wall outlet. You will also want to check the power switch on the device to ensure it is on. Lastly, if you have an additional power supply around, try that one to rule out supply issues\n\n\u2691 IF you are hearing a squealing sound or feedback, THEN: lower the microphone volume controls on the tower. You may also need to position the mic closer to your mouth. Finally, go to your Juno's settings and ensure that the 'Music Audio In' options is not checked.
