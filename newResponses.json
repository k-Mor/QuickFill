There are a few things you can try when it comes to troubleshooting common hardware or driver related issues.\n\nAttempt the following:\n\n\u2691 Search for 'Check for updates' in the lower left search bar on your taskbar\n\n\u2691 Once that menu opens up, select 'Check for updates'\n\n\u2691 After that process finishes, look for blue text that says 'View optional updates' on that same page. It is usually underneath the button to check for updates. If you do not know how to run the optional updates, check out this link:\nhttps://pureinfotech.com/install-optional-updates-windows-10/ \n\n\u2691 Allow those to finish, restart your computer, then attempt to use the hardware / software that you were initially trying to.\n\n\u2691 If you have a Kensington docking station at your desk, you may also want to power cycle that device as well, as that addresses many of the common display and audio issues staff members run into. To do this, locate the black cylindrical cable that is in the lowest possible port in the back panel. Unplug that cord, allow about 30 seconds to pass, plug the cord back in and see if that resolved your issue.\n\nIf you have concerns about these steps, or they did not work, please feel free to give us a call at {phone}, {days}, {hours}.

There are a few things we can try with document cameras that resolve many of the common issues teachers run into. First, ensure the following are in good order:\n\n\u2691 Check the power cable at the wall, and camera levels. If either side of the cable is loose, that could cause a variety of problems\n\n\u2691 Make sure that the video cable (HDMI) is firmly seated in both the camera, and the other end of the cable. The HDMI cable must be in the 'HDMI out' port in the document camera\n\n\u2691 Note that when booting up, the power light on the camera will flash red for about 3 seconds. After that, press the power button once and the light should turn green\n\n\u2691 Check the status of the power light. If it is amber or orange, check the switch on the right-side of the body, and ensure the little black switch is set to 'RGB.'\n\nIf all these things look in order, and you are still having trouble using your document camera, we may need to send out a building technician to your room.

That is the input you want your TV to be set to\n\n\u2691 If you are in a newer elementary school, locate the black box on the left-hand side of your television to switch between those HDMI options if you need to. Otherwise, you can use the touchscreen function to switch between the HDMI inputs if necessary\n\n\u2691 If everything looks good with the HDMI input, then your issue likely rests with your Actiontec\n\nIf you need more information, or you think your Actiontec is to blame, please feel free to respond back to this ticket for more information, or give us a call at {phone}, {days}, {hours}.

You can do this by clicking the little speaker symbol on the lower right-hand side of your taskbar, then selecting the correct output. You will also want to check the audio cable that links your Juno to the Actiontec in your classroom, if you have one.\n\n\u2691 IF you turn the tower on and only get a white screen, THEN: power off the tower, wait a full and complete minute, then turn the tower back on\n\n\u2691 IF the display will not turn on at all, THEN: verify that the power supply is plugged into both the receiver, and a working wall outlet. You will also want to check the power switch on the device to ensure it is on. Lastly, if you have an additional power supply around, try that one to rule out supply issues\n\n\u2691 IF you are hearing a squealing sound or feedback, THEN: lower the microphone volume controls on the tower. You may also need to position the mic closer to your mouth. Finally, go to your Juno's settings and ensure that the 'Music Audio In' options is not checked. You can find that option in the 'Microphone Volume Screen.' \n\nIf none of these apply to you, or the steps did not address your concern, then we may need to send out your building technician.

Connecting to the staff WIFI is a common question and it may be a little more involved than people realize. Here are the steps you can take to connect to PSDSTAFF:\n\n\u2691 Select the PSDSTAFF network\n\n\u2691 Ensure that the EAP setting is set to PEAP\n\n\u2691 Input your district credentials and ensure you only put in the segment before the @ sign. Note that this is case sensitive.\n\n\u2691 Under certificates, ensure that you select 'Do Not Validate'\n\n\u2691 Under advanced, look for an option that says 'Phase 2 Authenticate' then for that, input MSCHP V2\n\nAfter all that, you should be able to connect to the PSDSTAFF wireless network. If you have any questions about this, feel free to give us a call at {phone}, {days}, {hours}.",

Thankfully, logging into Employee Online is pretty straight forward if you know where to go and your staff credentials:\n\n\u2691 Username / Email: Everything before the @ sign in your staff email\n\n\u2691 Password: The same password you use to log into a staff device. If you have never reset this password it will follow this format - E000000Welcome! where the 0's are your employee ID. If you do not know your employee ID number, HR can provide that information to you by calling 253-841-1301.\n\n\u2691 Link to Employee Online\nhttps://employeeonline.puyallup.k12.wa.us/ifas7/login/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fbusinessplus%2femployeeonline%2fEOHomePage \n\nIf you need additional help logging in, feel free to give us a call at {phone}, {days}, {hours}.",

Securly is a very powerful tool that we use throughout the district, and it does a great job of keeping out inappropriate content. However it can be an inconvenience when something gets blocked that was previously accessible. Securly undergoes frequent updates that add websites, or web applications to its blocked list.\n\nAs such, if you are seeing the Securly page when trying to access a resource, that web page has likely been added to that list. Note that as a parent, you also have access to the Securly Home App which gives you granular control of your student's device. You can disable applications, block websites and control screen time all from your smart phone.\n\nIf you would like to know more about this, feel free to navigate to the link below! You are also more than welcome to reach out to Securly support by emailing: support@securly.com if you have specific questions about the service.
