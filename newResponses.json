There are a few things you can try when it comes to troubleshooting common hardware or driver related issues.\n\nAttempt the following:\n\n\u2022 Search for 'Check for updates' in the lower left search bar on your taskbar\n\n\u2022 Once that menu opens up, select 'Check for updates'\n\n\u2022 After that process finishes, look for blue text that says 'View optional updates' on that same page. It is usually underneath the button to check for updates. If you do not know how to run the optional updates, check out this link:\nhttps://pureinfotech.com/install-optional-updates-windows-10/ \n\n\u2022 Allow those to finish, restart your computer, then attempt to use the hardware / software that you were initially trying to.\n\n\u2022 If you have a Kensington docking station at your desk, you may also want to power cycle that device as well, as that addresses many of the common display and audio issues staff members run into. To do this, locate the black cylindrical cable that is in the lowest possible port in the back panel. Unplug that cord, allow about 30 seconds to pass, plug the cord back in and see if that resolved your issue.\n\nIf you have concerns about these steps, or they did not work, please feel free to give us a call at {phone}, {days}, {hours}.
